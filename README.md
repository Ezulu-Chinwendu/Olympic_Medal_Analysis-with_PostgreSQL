# Olympic Medal Analysis: PostgreSQL and Jupyter Integration
This project explores historical Olympic medal data using PostgreSQL integrated with Jupyter Notebook. By analyzing the data directly within the notebook environment, we can combine the power of SQL for querying with Python's rich data manipulation and visualization libraries.

### Tools and Technologies
Database: PostgreSQL
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
1. sqlalchemy for database connection
2. ipython-sql for running SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook
3. prettytable for tabular data formatting
4. pandas for data manipulation
